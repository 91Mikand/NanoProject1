The data used in this project can be found on the Stack Overflow website:

https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

I used the survey from the year 2017. 

## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The task at hand was to use the available data to answer some business questions. I decided to focus on professional developers.
I wanted to create a profile of a high-earning developer, hence I asked the following questions:

    1. In which countries professional developers earn the most?
    2. Does formal education have an impact on the Salary of a profesional developer?
    3. Is programming still a male-dominated field? Does Gender affect the Salary?

## Files <a name="files"></a>

**stack_overflow_survey_blogpost.ipynb** - jupyter notebook with the analysis
**survey_results_public.csv** - survey results
**survey_results_schema.csv** - survey schema (questions)

## Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

The conclusions of my analysis can be found in the following blogpost:

  I would like to thank Udacity for this great opportunity and Stack Overflow for sharing the data from their survey.
